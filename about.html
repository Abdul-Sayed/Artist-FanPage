            When John Maus (not to be confused with the John Maus of Walker Brothers fame) wasn't playing
            keyboards for
            Animal Collective, Panda Bear, and Haunted Graffiti, he was writing and recording his own
            hermetic,
            experimental, and oftentimes misunderstood compositions. Drawing on artists like David Bowie,
            Scott Walker,
            and Joy Division, Maus' swollen, distorted, and unabashedly strange debut, 2006's Songs, was more
            or less
            reviled by any and all music critics within earshot. CMJ wrote, "It took this Ariel Pink cohort
            five years to
            write and record his debut album, and only five minutes to become more annoying than Ariel Pink."
            Commenting
            on Maus' vocal style, Drowned in Sound's Mike Diver said that while some listeners "...will hear a
            little Nick
            Cave in it...others will hear a man crapping out of his mouth."
        </p>

            In spite of the harsh criticism (much of which Maus posted, to hilarious effect, on his MySpace
            profile), Maus
            continued to generate new material. His second album, Love Is Real, was released on Upset the
            Rhythm in 2007.
            Four years later, he returned with We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves, which
            featured some of
            his most dynamic and nuanced music to date. Compiling B-sides and unheard recordings made between
            1999 and
            2010, A Collection of Rarities and Previously Unreleased Material was released in 2012. His next
            studio album
            was again self-recorded at home over a span of a few years, but this time after finishing his
            doctorate (in
            political philosophy) and building his own custom set of modular synthesizers. The resulting
            Screen Memories
            emerged in 2017. With much of his prior work out of print by that point, Ribbon Music assembled
            the six-LP
            John Maus Boxset for the spring of 2018. Album number six in the set was 2018's Addendum, which
            was also
            released separately. ~ Margaret Reges
